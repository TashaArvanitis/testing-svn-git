# testing-svn-git
Test how svn and git interact so I can convert the heathens to git.

I have added things here to see what happens.

And again! I have added thigns.

Add another line through SVN.

BEEEEEEP

Git - no svn

Moral of the story? Git and SVN users can coexist, but you should NOT attempt to manage a repo using both on the same device. :D
